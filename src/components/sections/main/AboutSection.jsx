                I'm a 4th-year Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Sri Lanka, deeply passionate
                about building impactful software and leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. My project
                experience spans various applications, from developing a simple <a className="highlight-text" 
                href="https://github.com/MilanWeerasinghe/MusicApp" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>artist management system</a> to
                microservice-based solutions for hotel booking management.
            </p>

            <p className='mb-4'>
                In my work, I have utilized languages and
                technologies such as Java, JavaScript, and SQL, I am also familiar with front-end frameworks like React
                and backend tools like Spring Boot. I bring a solid understanding of software development methodologies,
                including agile practices and the principles of SOLID design, to build maintainable and efficient code. Eager
                to expand my expertise further, I am especially interested in getting hands-on experience with <span className='highlight-text'>AI/ML and
                full-stack development</span>. Through coding, I aspire to make meaningful contributions to innovative projects,
                continuously improve my skills, and ultimately drive positive change in technology and society.
